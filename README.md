# Guideline on how to use Github

Some simple guideline on this repository.

1. Make sure to update [.gitignore](./gitignore) to prevent commiting unnecessary files.

2. Please use correct work flow.
   - Main branch should only contain **working** and **stable** codes.
   - Development branch is used for development code.
     - Please make sure the code commited would not cause crash to other's work before commiting to this branch.
   - Hotfix branch is used for hot patching main branch.
     - The fix should be revised and merge to development branch afterward.
   - Feel free to open other branches, but remember to merge and close them after finish.

Read [git-flow](./git-flow.pdf) for more flow control information, or [git-usage](./git-usage.pdf) for how to use git.
